## Being a mentor
**How do I talk to hackers?​** 

Sometimes hackers may be a little shy about approaching company reps, so feel free to walk around the hacking area and introduce yourself, ask them what they’re working on, and offer your expertise! We’ll also be using a mentor queue to match mentors to hackers.

**Mentor queue?**​ ​

This will be our live ticketing system during the event. Whenever hackers need help, they can post a ticket descrbing their issue and their location, and then mentors will be able to claim the tickets and come to the rescue! We highly recommend that mentors should attend a quick orientation (see schedule) to use the queue most effectively. If the mentors cannot attend, then they can access the queue at ​go.hackmit.org/q​— they can ask an attendant at the help desk for mentor privileges and a brief description of how to use it effectively.
