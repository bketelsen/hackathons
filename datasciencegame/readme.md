## GPU info
When a student on an Academic Grant (143P) tries to spin up a higher-level GPU, they will be directed to create a quota request.  Each NVS/NDS/NCSv3/NCSv2 quota request is reviewed individually, but in general due to high demand for these graphics-enabled VM types, availability is limited for customers using free/benefit/sponsorship subscriptions.

Best practice: Use NC or NV (v1) SKUs for their GPU needs.
