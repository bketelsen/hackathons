## Being a mentor
**What resources do I point hackers to?**

[aka.ms/hackwithazure](https://aka.ms/hackwithazure) is a good place to start (feel free to fork, pull request and contribute) but also, whatever **you** think is a good resource!

**How do I talk to hackers?â€‹** 

Sometimes hackers may be a little shy about approaching company reps, so feel free to walk around the hacking area and introduce yourself, ask them what theyâ€™re working on, and offer your expertise! Weâ€™ll also be using a mentor queue to match mentors to hackers.

**Mentor queue?**â€‹ â€‹

This will be our live ticketing system during the event. Whenever hackers need help, they can post a ticket descrbing their issue and their location, and then mentors will be able to claim the tickets and come to the rescue! We highly recommend that mentors should attend a quick orientation (see schedule) to use the queue most effectively. If the mentors cannot attend, then they can access the queue at â€‹go.hackmit.org/qâ€‹â€” they can ask an attendant at the help desk for mentor privileges and a brief description of how to use it effectively.
