## Azure API prize
Use any Azure service (like, any of them...) and enter our API prize (Azure Champ Challenge). Winners will recieve an Xbox One X for each team member and your hack will be entered into our Imagine Cup competition (the grand prize last year was a mentoring session with CEO Satya and $85k).

I recommend Cognitive Services in particular!
